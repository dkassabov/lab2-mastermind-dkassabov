The Codebreaker starts the round by placing four code pegs into the first row
of holes on the gameboard for the first guess.

If any of the code pegs are in the correct color and position
    -> The Codemaker places a black key peg next to the guess

If any of the code pegs are in the correct color but wrong position
    -> The Codemaker places a white key peg next to the guess.

No keypegs are placed if a color peg in the guess is not used in the secret code.
